Real-Time-Face-Recognition-Based-Student-Attendance-System

🚀 Project Overview:

I've designed a cutting-edge face recognition-based attendance system that captures and processes student images in real-time to log their attendance efficiently and with accuracy at the frontend. This system is integrated at the backend with Firebase's Realtime Database and Cloud Storage for dynamic and reliable management of student data.
Key Features


🔍 Key Features:

✨ Real-Time Face Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV and face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces in real-time.

✨ Attendance Time Check: This model ensure that students are not marked present multiple times within a short period, maintaining the integrity of attendance records.

✨ Detailed Student Information Display: Shows comprehensive student information, including TOTAL ATTENDANCE, COURSE, BRANCH, BATCH, LAST MARKED ATTENDANCE providing a complete view of the student profile.

✨ Seamless Firebase Integration: Efficiently stores and retrieves student records and images using Firebase's real-time database and cloud storage, ensuring data is always up-to-date and accessible.

✨ Automated Attendance Logging: Upon successful face recognition, the system automatically updates attendance records in the Firebase database, reducing manual work and minimizing errors.

✨ Dynamic GUI Display: Features a custom GUI using OpenCV that dynamically displays student information, attendance status, and other relevant details in an user-friendly manner.

✨ Face Encoding and Storage: The system encodes student facial features into vectors and saves these encodings for accurate face matching during the recognition process.


🛠️ Technical Stack:
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV, face_recognition, cvzone, firebase_admin, NumPy, pickle. 
- Database: Firebase Realtime Database
- Cloud Storage: Firebase Storage

This project not only enhances the efficiency of attendance systems but also showcases the potential of integrating advanced technologies for practical applications. I'm excited about the possibilities this technology holds for the future of education! 🌐📚
